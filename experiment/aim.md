## Aim of experiment

This experiment enables a student to learn
- 1.How to set the number of levels of a quantizer
- Calculate the error involved after quantization of the signal.

The principal objective of this experiment is to understand the principle of quantization of continuous-amplitude discrete-time analog signals
